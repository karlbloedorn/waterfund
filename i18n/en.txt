	"background_body" : "Upstream, in the foggy highlands of <span id='item_colombia' class='highlighted_word'>Colombia</span>, water begins its path downhill, emerging in the paramo and springs, passing through creeks, filtering through grasslands and agricultural landscapes, and joining creeks and rivers, finally arriving to the flat zones to provide water for Colombian homes and irrigation of sugar cane fields.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Along this path, many people—farmers, schools, communities, and many others—are working to improve their lands to ensure that water flows through clean and healthy landscapes that will determine the quality and quantity of water making it all the way downstream. The water fund, Fundacion de Agua por la Vida y la Sostenibilidad (Foundation Water for Life and Sustainability), works on the <span id='item_cauca_river' class='highlighted_word'>Cauca River watershed</span> that extends from the Cauca Valley to the Cauca department.

	"person_story_amalia": "Amalia moved to the town of Pradera over 20 years ago to be a social worker for the recently established river association Asobolo (Association of users of the Bolo River), eventually becoming the director. In addition to the challenge of introducing a new program, Asobolo's initial work started amidst immense social and economic challenges: Colombia's internal conflict had created a general environment of distrust that discouraged landowners from joining the program. Thanks to Amalia's enduring work with the community, together with the work of thousands of farmers, indigenous communities, and rural communities, over 900 hectares of critical source watershed areas, including 218 springs, are now under conservation.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Everyone knows Amalia. People wave at her as she drives by and eagerly greet her with \"tinto\" (coffee) and pastries. When asked why they joined the program, a common answer is \"because of Dr. Amalia.\" She explains that her work involves \"long walks and visits\" and \"one-on-one relationships.\" These relationships take time to build and are critical for water funds to work. As Amalia explains, the water fund provides the financial resources and the associations like Asobolo provide presence in the field<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Now, with better public safety on the horizon, Amalia sees opportunities to conserve the fragile páramo ecosystem in the headwaters of the watershed, which was once off limits due to unrest. She notes the importance of working closely with local communities in this effort - \"we can have all the money of the world, but, if the community does not want to work [with us], the water fund cannot exist.",

	"person_story_guido" : "Guido Prado grows sugar cane for a living in a separate farmland. On the land where he lives, he focuses on water and forest protection. The Agua Clara River, which feeds the Bolo River, flows alongside Guido’s property, so he feels responsible for it. Guido has worked with Asobolo for 6 years to plant more than 1200 trees in the riparian forest along Agua Clara that flows through his property.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Asobolo has helped with this work, but Guido has also invested his own time and resources to expand the conservation work on his property. He maintains a four-hectare forest, seven waterfalls to replenish water with oxygen and water ponds to reduce sediment. He has run out of space to do any farming or other activities that generate income on this property. \"Not even the fruit-trees are intended to generate income,\" he says, \"they are mostly for the birds to eat.\"<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Although his conservation work is demanding, \"the satisfaction to know that I am contributing something (…) and knowing that I have something to do with the tree that grew, the forest I have, and the birdies coming back to the area\" motivates him to do this work.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Guido already see the benefits of conservation in terms of water, biodiversity, and deep connection with their land. As Guido says, \"people have forgotten that with money one does not live, one only survives,\" pointing to the non-monetary values brought by conservation. But there are also challenges. Illegal deforestation of Guadua trees he planted (widely used for construction by locals) and new development upstream worry him. Although he feels responsible for taking care of water streams, he feels that the public government does not support his work, \"these areas are still stigmatized by the conflict and representatives still avoid coming to these areas.\"",

	"person_story_school": "\"Water protection is not just work with farmers upstream; it is also a matter of creating a culture of conservation at both community and watershed levels.\" Amalia Morales, Asobolo Director<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>In addition to working with upstream farmers, Asobolo works with local schools, connecting with around 13,000 students, to develop environmental stewardship programming.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Tucked in the cloud forest next to the \"Flores Amarillas--Yellow Flowers\" creek, Mercedes Abrego School, one of Asobolo school-partners, has prioritized environmental education. Teachers Fabian, Andrea, and Elizabeth explain that, in rural zones like this, the school is \"the center of life, where parents and children go--creating a meeting point that generates ideas.\" The ecology club is one of these ideas. With financial support from Asobolo and other institutions, the club runs environmental stewardship workshops where students plant trees, visit springs, and learn about the local hydrology, vegetation, and wildlife. Students have learned to love nature and care for it. For instance, some students that used to bring slingshots to capture birds have stopped this practice, teacher Fabian says, reflecting on the progress made.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div> Amalia considers schools and their students \"indirect participants\" in Asobolo. Students are future stewards of the land, and teaching them about water is key to achieving a culture of sustainable environmental stewardship. Teachers also think that environmental activities are positive for the students' rural identities. \"Don't call me like that, I am not a farmer!\" students used to say when asked to dress up as farmers for school activities. \"Now they recognize themselves as farmers and are proud of their rural identity,\" teacher Andrea notes. The teachers are certain that feelings of rural pride were lost during Colombia's internal conflict, so it is mostly their teaching and the work they do with Asobolo on environmental stewardship that is helping the students embrace rural identity and pride back.",

	"person_story_manuel" : "Water funds exist worldwide, and Agua por la Vida is one of the most developed. As a result, Agua por la Vida hosts many visitors, from local scientists to high-level business executives and leaders of NGOs. Esteban’s farm \"El Edén\" in the highlands of Palmira is always the first stop. <div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Esteban is passionate about conservation and about sharing his experiences with people from around the world. He immediately explains that we are standing at 2000 meters above sea level, right at the boundary with the high cloud forest that towers above his farm. He points out that many visitors come to his farm to learn about the projects he does with Asobolo and other groups. A visit with Esteban starts with his orchid collection and travels down through his steeply sloped property, which he manages as agroforest, including a mix of native forest trees, lulo (a popular Colombian fruit), avocado, and ornamental plants. Esteban considers it is his identity and \"duty\" to work to conserve nature and biodiversity on his farm. He is acutely aware of these species nearly going extinct due to large-scale deforestation generations ago.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Esteban describes himself as a \"victim of the conflict.\" While many people fled this zone, Esteban stayed. His connection to his land and farm is strong, and his work with Asobolo and Agua por la Vida have allowed him to increase productivity on his farm as well as ensure the environmental quality that is so important to him. While he is happy with his collaboration with Asobolo, he expresses a need for electricity in the area, pointing to one of the many ways the work of water fund suppliers could be supported.",
	"person_quote_community" : "We do conservation independently of any institution since centuries ago, and we do it because it is our identity.",
	"person_story_community" : "The Kwet Wala Community is located deep in the cloud forest. They emphasize that they lead and design their conservation activities based on their own independent \"plan de manejo--management plan.\" Among other things, they want to protect forest on 70% of their 1,200 hectares and protect all 60 springs with living fences.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>The community has agreed to grant an interview because they see an opportunity to voice why they conserve and how they do it. First, they manage their resources as an ecosystem, not just water, \"We do not talk about the forest or water [only]; we talk about nature.\" Second, their approach is \"conserving the harmony of the territory\" between the air, animals, soil, water, and mountains, all of whom they refer as \"the big and younger brothers living inside the forest.\" Third, conserving nature allows them to \"stay connected and communicate with those who are not here anymore.\" This is their connection to their ancestors. <div class='paragraph-cut'></div>The members of the Kwet Wala Indigenous Community recognize that participating in Agua por la Vida through Asobolo has given them a platform to make this identity recognized and valued. Asobolo is one of the few institutions that has supported their conservation work, but they make it clear to me that they do not do the work because Asobolo tells them to. Instead, they firmly state, \"we do conservation independently of any institution since centuries ago, and we do it because is our identity.\"",
	"person_quote_diego" : "Protecting his water sources with the help of Asobolo is his only tool to avoid “having to bring water in buckets from elsewhere,” if the springs go dry, a concern especially during the summer.",
	"person_story_diego" : "The springs in Diego's \"finca--farm\" are his sole source of water for his livestock to drink and for his own domestic use. Aqueducts do not reach his house. Protecting his water sources with the help of Asobolo is his only tool to avoid \"having to bring water in buckets from elsewhere,\" if the springs go dry, a concern especially during the summer. With the help of Asobolo, he has fenced off the nine springs in his area with living fences to keep his animals out of his water source.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Diego's farm is small, barely 3-hectares in size, and three quarters of that is fenced off to protect water sources, so it cannot be used for food production or grazing. However, giving up land for water is a good trade-off, \"water gives value to the finca,\" he says, and there are other benefits. Many people here use guadua, a bamboo like tree, to build fences. These trees as perceived to be good at regulating humidity around springs and creeks, and they are useful for construction. Diego built part of his house with this tree. For many people upstream, materials to build houses and fences to protect water are very expensive, so growing guadua is both a conservation and economic strategy.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Diego's main challenge for conservation is the cost of maintaining living fences. Some of his fences have fallen, and re-building is not part of Asobolo's budget. He needs trees, barbed wire, staples, and wages to re-build them, which he cannot afford.",
	"person_quote_humberto" : "For him the community’s lack of sceptic systems and sewage treatment are needs that affect both the watershed and community’s well-being, and he is already thinking about how to confront this issue.",
	"person_story_humberto": "Humberto Prieto works on his own farm to protect water quality and organizes others in his area around projects that enhance economic productivity and food security. He explains the importance of integrating conservation and productive activities - \"I do believe that it's important to make people aware of the importance of watershed conservation and management, but I also believe that it is important to provide resources to do it and help the community out.\"<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Many share Humberto's opinion. Offering agroforestry and silvopasture projects is a path to \"starting conversations with the community,\" said a manager at a watershed-governing meeting, highlighting the importance of these programs for participation. Depending on funding availability, Asobolo provides cover crops and fruit trees--such as avocado trees--to participants, but funding for these projects are unsteady.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Humberto thinks that there is much to do to take care of water--and the community. For him the community's lack of sceptics and sewage treatment are needs that affect both the watershed and community's well-being, and he is already thinking about how to confront this issue. With the support of Asobolo and other institutions, he plans to apply for funds from the government's internal conflict reparations program to help address these issues.",
	"person_quote_oscar" : "Five years ago, water did not reach us—but now (after work with Asobolo) it does.\"",
	"person_story_oscar" : "Water funds such as APLV work with people upstream to do source water conservation to secure water for people downstream. This might lead to the perception that people upstream are \"water secure\" but, in fact, people living in the Bolo subwatershed—especially ranchers and farmers—expressed deep concern about decreasing water flows.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>For Mr. Oscar Andres, a rancher in the Bolo watershed, water scarcity concerns motivated him to join Asobolo as a strategy to secure water for his property. His work with Asobolo has consisted in establishing living fences around springs, maintaining a riparian corridor to protect the creek flowing along his property, and organizing cleaning campaigns upstream (for rivers that get obstructed with sediment. He perceives that this work has improved water supply for his property, \"five years ago, water did not reach us—but now (after work with Asobolo) it does,\" he says.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Mr. Martinez ranch is part of his identity, and it is his family’s heritage, he says, as he proudly shows his livestock and orange farm, but he is also proud that his water conservation work also protects local vegetation. As we head to the most arboreous part of the ranch; the sound of falling water announces the creek that has been restored. \"The livestock used to graze freely along the water and would polluted, and there were not trees, now there is diversity,\" he says, pointing to the tree species he has grown: cachuelos, matas and hualhuas—mostly native trees. Like a couple of other farmers around here, his conservation work has got him thinking about  his ranch as an an eco-tourist destination, \"but not so much a resort,\" he says, as he wants to keep the ranching identity alive.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Participants like Mr. Martinez that join Asobolo to secure water for his lands, already perceive that reforestation and protection of water sources have restored or even improved water flows. Now climate change is slowly becoming a major concern for farmers, \"Harsher summers\" in the area are attributed to climate change and it \"dries out\" the soil, Mr. Martinez says, explaining the extra effort to work the land during the summers. Apart from securing water for his property, climate change is an extra reason to work with Asobolo.",
	"person_quote_otoniel" : "Otoniel Ocuyame describes his land as “the best known for their concern for the environment.” In school, he learned good practices to manage farms sustainably that inspired him to implement a silvopasture system with his own resources",
	"person_story_otoniel" : "Many participants of Agua por la Vida have a deep concern about the identity of their \"fincaranch\"—in terms of their environmental friendliness. For Otoniel Ocuyame, owner of a 576-hectare land with passing-through streams, making his finca sustainable is a major concern and motivation to participate in the program. Very proudly, he describes his farm as one of the best \"conserved of the zone and characterized by our concern for the environment.\" Being a zootechnician with vast knowledge in best management practices, he independently, and with his own resources, has designed and implemented a silvopasture system. Later with Asobolo, he focused on protecting streams using buffers and living fences covering 60 hectares of his land.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>While the goal of Agua por la Vida has been to protect water, for him the benefits of doing water conservation work are multi-layered. A silvopasture systems, for instance, helps him to decrease nutrient, provide shade for his livestock, and is helping combat climate change, too. People upstream already talk about the effects of climate change with perceived harsher summers that take a toll on the health of livestock. Mr. Otoniel already perceives that trees in his silovpasture system make up for refreshing temperature that \"reduce heat-stress in the livestock that lead to improved nutrition and production.\" Similarly, to delimit his paddocks, he opts for using ecological corridors—that connect local wildlife such as deer, coatis, armadillos—instead of traditional fencing. \"Implementing all of this is arduous but rewarding—not only in economic terms, but also in terms of what I contribute to humanity,\" he adds, pointing to stewardship values that underpin his participation but that are under-supported. People around here would like to conserve more but resources are limited and other needs, such as food security, feel more urgent.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>If it was not for the support of Asobolo that provided him the guidance and materials to expand his conservation work, he doubts he could have achieved this. The costs of implementing these type of projects are too high for many to overcome, and, in this area, farmers like Mr. Otoniel are just recovering from the economic losses left by Colombia’s internal conflict. For people like him, the small, albeit crucial support of Asobolo is invaluable. As peace is returning to the area, Mr. Otoniel likes to think about the many more plans to make his finca even more sustainable and describes himself as \"the happiest person in the world.\"",
	"person_quote_ediberto" : "The challenges are bigger than just a lack of resources. For many “the culture here has been to clean the forest,” referring to years of intensive farming practices in which replacing forests with grasslands",
	"person_story_ediberto" : "As we stand in the forest of the Cauca Valley, a landscape of \"all colors of green,\" it is hard to imagine that native ecosystems are slowly disappearing to ever-expanding grazing fields. Mr. Perea, who apart from managing his family’s ranch with livestock, works for Asobolo measuring water flow and quality, knows this first-hand. Without adequate management, livestock damages soils and stream banks, and contaminates waterways. Riparian forests, in particular, loose their soil-retention capabilities, causing stream sedimentation that depletes water quality and aquatic life. To ameliorate this, Silvopasture, programs—a combination of grazing and forestry—are an increasing strategy worldwide to enhance soil protection and to recover native vegetation and wildlife.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>For Mr. Perea, making his land more sustainable by \"increasing tree cover and soil cover\" motivated him to implement a silvoparture system—that entails high cost. It has been a long overdue goal, he says, \"As farmers, we do not have enough money to build these systems.\" Asobolo provided all the necessary materials, technical assistance, and motivation to implement a silvopasture system, he tells me. Walking around his property that oversees the endless valley, he shows visitors the results of this work: increased shade for the livestock and more fruit trees benefit his ranch, but cover crops that reduce nutrient losses benefit water. In addition, he buiilt ecological as division of padlocks for wildlife to transit, \"Now one is able to see cottontail rabbits,\" he says, as he talks about how his work helps nature, too.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Mr. Perea’s experience is, unfortunately, one of the few around this area. Apart from lack or resources, \"the culture here has been to clean the forest,\" leaving cattle without shade and prone to heat stress and birds without trees to rest, he tells me. Changing cultures and mindsets are daunting tasks; however, Mr. Perea feels that is starting a chain of change. His own neighbors want to join Asobolo, too, and that might be due to his example, he says.",
	"person_quote_trujillo" : "I may always have water in my field because it emerges here, but I am conscious that water is needed downstream, not only for communities but also for other crops and livestock",
	"person_story_trujillo" : "For many farmers and ranchers upstream, caring for water is a sentiment embedded in efforts to make their lands more environmentally sustainable while ensuring clean water for people downstream. This is especially true for landowners such as Mr. Gustavo Trujillo that have water sources such as springs in their own lands, \"I may always have water in my field because it emerges here, but I am conscious that water is needed downstream, not only for communities but also for other crops and livestock,\" he says. Like him, many others participants perceive that having water sources in their lands make them independent in terms of water supply but also influential in the quality of water that reaches people downstream.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Ensuring water sustainability for his agricultural land and people downstream has motivated him to join Asobolo. Mr. Trujillo’s work towards conservation in his field involves maintaining most of his land (almost 80 percent) forested while the rest is used for agriculture and livestock purposes and, with Asobolo, he has buffered springs and creeks along 7 kilometers of his property, using living fences . He hopes that all of these strategies together can protect \"the water bank\" he considers his land to be, which he believes supplies a considerable portion of water that travels downstream.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>His water conservation work has also come with difficult choices, such as having to trade off land with conservation. From a business perspective, these decisions are hard, \"not only we confront maintenance costs,\" he says, but also \"one loses productive land.\" For many, included, Mr. Trujillo, this is a meaningful barrier, especially when the property is small. While monetary compensations has been mentioned as a possible compensation, people like Mr.Trujillo emphasized on silvospature and agroforestry as productive projects that, \"should be integrated in these programs; they benefit and motivate landowners to conserve more.\"",
