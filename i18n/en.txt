	"background_body" : "Upstream, in the foggy highlands of <span id='item_colombia' class='highlighted_word'>Colombia</span>, water begins its path downhill, emerging in the paramo and springs, passing through creeks, filtering through grasslands and agricultural landscapes, and joining creeks and rivers, finally arriving to the flat zones to provide water for Colombian homes and irrigation of sugar cane fields.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Along this path, many people—farmers, schools, communities, and many others—are working to improve their lands to ensure that water flows through clean and healthy landscapes that will determine the quality and quantity of water making it all the way downstream. The water fund, Fundacion de Agua por la Vida y la Sostenibilidad (Foundation Water for Life and Sustainability), works on the <span id='item_cauca_river' class='highlighted_word'>Cauca River watershed</span> that extends from the Cauca Valley to the Cauca department.

	"person_story_ediberto" : "As we stand in the forest of the Cauca Valley, a landscape of “all colors of green,\" it is hard to imagine that native ecosystems are slowly disappearing to ever-expanding grazing fields. Mr. Perea, who apart from managing his family’s ranch with livestock, works for Asobolo measuring water flow and quality, knows this first-hand. Without adequate management, livestock damages soils and stream banks, and contaminates waterways. Riparian forests, in particular, loose their soil-retention capabilities, causing stream sedimentation that depletes water quality and aquatic life. To ameliorate this, Silvopasture, programs—a combination of grazing and forestry—are an increasing strategy worldwide to enhance soil protection and to recover native vegetation and wildlife.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>For Mr. Perea, making his land more sustainable by “increasing tree cover and soil cover\" motivated him to implement a silvoparture system—that entails high cost. It has been a long overdue goal, he says, “As farmers, we do not have enough money to build these systems.\" Asobolo provided all the necessary materials, technical assistance, and motivation to implement a silvopasture system, he tells me. Walking around his property that oversees the endless valley, he shows visitors the results of this work: increased shade for the livestock and more fruit trees benefit his ranch, but cover crops that reduce nutrient losses benefit water. In addition, he buiilt ecological as division of padlocks for wildlife to transit, “Now one is able to see cottontail rabbits,\" he says, as he talks about how his work helps nature, too.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Mr. Perea’s experience is, unfortunately, one of the few around this area. Apart from lack or resources, “the culture here has been to clean the forest,\" leaving cattle without shade and prone to heat stress and birds without trees to rest, he tells me. Changing cultures and mindsets are daunting tasks; however, Mr. Perea feels that is starting a chain of change. His own neighbors want to join Asobolo, too, and that might be due to his example, he says.",
	"person_story_otoniel" : "Many participants of Agua por la Vida have a deep concern about the identity of their “fincaranch\"—in terms of their environmental friendliness. For Otoniel Ocuyame, owner of a 576-hectare land with passing-through streams, making his finca sustainable is a major concern and motivation to participate in the program. Very proudly, he describes his farm as one of the best “conserved of the zone and characterized by our concern for the environment.\" Being a zootechnician with vast knowledge in best management practices, he independently, and with his own resources, has designed and implemented a silvopasture system. Later with Asobolo, he focused on protecting streams using buffers and living fences covering 60 hectares of his land.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>While the goal of Agua por la Vida has been to protect water, for him the benefits of doing water conservation work are multi-layered. A silvopasture systems, for instance, helps him to decrease nutrient, provide shade for his livestock, and is helping combat climate change, too. People upstream already talk about the effects of climate change with perceived harsher summers that take a toll on the health of livestock. Mr. Otoniel already perceives that trees in his silovpasture system make up for refreshing temperature that “reduce heat-stress in the livestock that lead to improved nutrition and production.\" Similarly, to delimit his paddocks, he opts for using ecological corridors—that connect local wildlife such as deer, coatis, armadillos—instead of traditional fencing. “Implementing all of this is arduous but rewarding—not only in economic terms, but also in terms of what I contribute to humanity,\" he adds, pointing to stewardship values that underpin his participation but that are under-supported. People around here would like to conserve more but resources are limited and other needs, such as food security, feel more urgent.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>If it was not for the support of Asobolo that provided him the guidance and materials to expand his conservation work, he doubts he could have achieved this. The costs of implementing these type of projects are too high for many to overcome, and, in this area, farmers like Mr. Otoniel are just recovering from the economic losses left by Colombia’s internal conflict. For people like him, the small, albeit crucial support of Asobolo is invaluable. As peace is returning to the area, Mr. Otoniel likes to think about the many more plans to make his finca even more sustainable and describes himself as \"the happiest person in the world.\"",
	"person_story_trujillo" : "For many farmers and ranchers upstream, caring for water is a sentiment embedded in efforts to make their lands more environmentally sustainable while ensuring clean water for people downstream. This is especially true for landowners such as Mr. Gustavo Trujillo that have water sources such as springs in their own lands, “I may always have water in my field because it emerges here, but I am conscious that water is needed downstream, not only for communities but also for other crops and livestock,\" he says. Like him, many others participants perceive that having water sources in their lands make them independent in terms of water supply but also influential in the quality of water that reaches people downstream.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Ensuring water sustainability for his agricultural land and people downstream has motivated him to join Asobolo. Mr. Trujillo’s work towards conservation in his field involves maintaining most of his land (almost 80 percent) forested while the rest is used for agriculture and livestock purposes and, with Asobolo, he has buffered springs and creeks along 7 kilometers of his property, using living fences . He hopes that all of these strategies together can protect \"the water bank\" he considers his land to be, which he believes supplies a considerable portion of water that travels downstream.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>His water conservation work has also come with difficult choices, such as having to trade off land with conservation. From a business perspective, these decisions are hard, “not only we confront maintenance costs,\" he says, but also “one loses productive land.\" For many, included, Mr. Trujillo, this is a meaningful barrier, especially when the property is small. While monetary compensations has been mentioned as a possible compensation, people like Mr.Trujillo emphasized on silvospature and agroforestry as productive projects that, \"should be integrated in these programs; they benefit and motivate landowners to conserve more.\"",
	"person_story_guido" : "Guido Prado grows sugar cane for a living in a separate farmland. On the land where he lives, he focuses on water and forest protection. The Agua Clara River, which feeds the Bolo River, flows alongside Guido’s property, so he feels responsible for it. Guido has worked with Asobolo for 6 years to plant more than 1200 trees in the riparian forest along Agua Clara that flows through his property.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Asobolo has helped with this work, but Guido has also invested his own time and resources to expand the conservation work on his property. He maintains a four-hectare forest, seven waterfalls to replenish water with oxygen and water ponds to reduce sediment. He has run out of space to do any farming or other activities that generate income on this property. \"Not even the fruit-trees are intended to generate income,\" he says, \"they are mostly for the birds to eat.\"<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Although his conservation work is demanding, “the satisfaction to know that I am contributing something (…) and knowing that I have something to do with the tree that grew, the forest I have, and the birdies coming back to the area” motivates him to do this work.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Guido already see the benefits of conservation in terms of water, biodiversity, and deep connection with their land. As Guido says, \"people have forgotten that with money one does not live, one only survives,\" pointing to the non-monetary values brought by conservation. But there are also challenges. Illegal deforestation of Guadua trees he planted (widely used for construction by locals) and new development upstream worry him. Although he feels responsible for taking care of water streams, he feels that the public government does not support his work, “these areas are still stigmatized by the conflict and representatives still avoid coming to these areas.\"",
	"person_story_naomi" : "Naomi Beltran owns a ranch with springs, native forests, and one more particular feature, a fault scarp very prone to erosion that reaches streams. This is a challenge that Naomi and Asobolo have been working together to overcome. “Due to the faulting scarp, we have lost many trees; they tend to fall because of the movement,\" she explains. For more than 5 years, Asobolo has helped Naomi’s family to design and implement reforestation strategies around the faulting area and other parts of the ranch to reduce erosion.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>While reducing erosion from the faulting may be limited, she has water sources that she can protect more effectively. Living fences mark buffers that separate grazing land from water banks, which prevent livestock from eroding key water source areas. In addition, 60 per cent of her more than 100 hectare-property is under conservation of native forest, “We have to take advantage of the beauty we have here in Colombia; we have springs, forests, native species that other ranches no longer have,\" Naomi says, pointing to her conservation values and her personal responsibility to protect nature in her property.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Naomi’s conservation work is also a way to secure water for her own property. While water funds are about to secure water for downstream, many people upstream work with Asobolo to address water scarcity concerns in their own properties. Many, including Naomi, perceive that “Trees help maintain water in the property even during harsh summers,\" revealing why Naomi has choosen to conserve tree cover in her property and plant even more.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Many people have visited Naomi’s conservation work and that has generated a new idea. Naomi’s “proyecto de vida—project of life\" is to turn her ranch into an eco-tourism destination that teaches people about traditional ranching in Colombia, water protection and even about the faulting scarp. Yet, the faulting scarp itself challenges all of her plans, but only Asobolo has helped, “Each ranch has its own problems. Look, I have a fault scarp in my property,\" she says, pointing to the unique challenges for conservation that many people here face.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Water funds exist worldwide, and Agua por la Vida is one of the most developed. As a result, FAVPS hosts lots of visitors, from local scientists to high-level business executives and leaders of NGOs. Esteban x’s farm is always the first stop. In a mountainous landscape that can be hard to travel through, this is partly because his farm is close to town, But it’s mostly because Esteban is passionate about conservation and about sharing his experiences with people from around the world. A visit with Esteban starts with his orchid collection and travels down through his steeply sloped property, managed as agroforest, including a mix of native forest trees, lulo (a popular Colombian fruit), avocado, and ornamental plants. Leah first visited Esteban about 3 years ago and had a chance to help plant an endangered tree --Comino Crespo--in his farm. According to Esteban, this tree, alongside the over x others that he has planted with Asobolo and Agua por la Vida, make his land xxxxxx.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Esteban describes himself as a “victim of the conflict.\" While many people fled this zone, Esteban stayed. His connection to his land and farm is strong, and his work with Asobolo and Agua por la Vida have allowed him to increase productivity on his farm as well as ensure the environmental quality that is so important to him.",
	"person_story_humberto": "\"There cannot be conservation where there is hunger,\" is a phrase that participants and managers of \"Agua por la Vids\" repeatedly state as they talk about their work upstream. One of them is Humberto Prieto, for whom participating in water conservation is a way of taking care of his community. As a farmer upstream, apart from doing water conservation in his property, he also outreaches support to launch various initiatives that enhance economic productivity and food security while, at the same time, protect water quality. For many participants and managers, integrating water conservation with productive projects, such as agroforestry and silvopasture, that attend local socio-economic needs, is a crucial for successful and sustainable water conservation activities. As Mr. Prieto puts it, “I do believe that it’s important to make people aware of the importance of watershed conservation and management, but I also believe that it is important to provide resources to do it and help the community out.\"<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Many people upstream engaged with Agua por la Vida already are aware of the importance of managing the watershed. Mr. Prieto himself has fenced the part of his property around springs and creeks to protect water sources and implemented silvopasture systems to diminish nutrient losses. While it is common to think that farmers demur setting land apart for conservation, for Mr. Prieto “giving out part of the land towards water conservation is not really an issue—land without water is worthless.\" Still, he thinks that there is much more to do to truly take care of water—and the community. For him the community’s lack sceptic system and sewage are needs that affect both the watershed and community’s well-being, and he is already thinking about how to confront this issue. With the support of Asobolo and other institutions, he plans to apply for funds from the government’s internal conflict reparations program to help solving these issues.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Participants consider productive projects a crucial piece of water protection upstream and water managers do, too. Offering agroforestry and silvopasture projects is a path to “starting conversations with the community\" said a manager at a watershed-governing meeting, highlighting the importance of these programs for participation. If this is the case, why are productive projects a missing piece in the APLV programming? “They exists but intermittently,\" said Dr. Amalia, Asobolo’s director. In the past, Asobolo has provided cover crops and fruit trees—such as avocado trees—to participants, but funding for these projects are unsteady. While this is the case, Mr. Prieto remind us that “people want to do conservation but they also need to the market,\" pointing to the importance of weaving community development and water protection for integrated, successful watershed management programs.",
	"person_story_oscar" : "Water funds such as APLV work with people upstream to do source water conservation to secure water for people downstream. This might lead to the perception that people upstream are “water secure\" but, in fact, people living in the Bolo subwatershed—especially ranchers and farmers—expressed deep concern about decreasing water flows.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>For Mr. Oscar Andres, a rancher in the Bolo watershed, water scarcity concerns motivated him to join Asobolo as a strategy to secure water for his property. His work with Asobolo has consisted in establishing living fences around springs, maintaining a riparian corridor to protect the creek flowing along his property, and organizing cleaning campaigns upstream (for rivers that get obstructed with sediment. He perceives that this work has improved water supply for his property, “five years ago, water did not reach us—but now (after work with Asobolo) it does,\" he says.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Mr. Martinez ranch is part of his identity, and it is his family’s heritage, he says, as he proudly shows his livestock and orange farm, but he is also proud that his water conservation work also protects local vegetation. As we head to the most arboreous part of the ranch; the sound of falling water announces the creek that has been restored. “The livestock used to graze freely along the water and would polluted, and there were not trees, now there is diversity,\" he says, pointing to the tree species he has grown: cachuelos, matas and hualhuas—mostly native trees. Like a couple of other farmers around here, his conservation work has got him thinking about  his ranch as an an eco-tourist destination, “but not so much a resort,\" he says, as he wants to keep the ranching identity alive.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Participants like Mr. Martinez that join Asobolo to secure water for his lands, already perceive that reforestation and protection of water sources have restored or even improved water flows. Now climate change is slowly becoming a major concern for farmers, “Harsher summers\" in the area are attributed to climate change and it “dries out\" the soil, Mr. Martinez says, explaining the extra effort to work the land during the summers. Apart from securing water for his property, climate change is an extra reason to work with Asobolo.",
	"person_story_diego" : "The springs in Diego Marquez’s “finca—ranch\" are the only water source supplying his land with for irrigation needs, for his livestock to drink, and for his own domestic uses. Where he leaves—in the lowlands of the foggy mountains—aqueducts do not reach him. Protecting his water sources with the help of Asobolo is his only tool to avoid “having to bring water in buckets from elsewhere,\" if the springs go dry, a latent concern especially during the summer, he says. With the help of Asobolo, he has fenced off all the nine water springs in his area with living fences to keep his animals out of his water source.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>His property is small in comparison to other participants around here whose lands can be as big as 100 hectares. Mr. Marquez’s finca is barely 3-hectares in size, and three quarters of that is fenced off to protect water sources instead of used for food production or grazing. But giving up land for water is a good trade-off, “water gives values to the finca,\" he says, plus he receives other benefits than just water. The guadua tree—a bamboo like tree—is the preferred tree to build fences around springs. Many people here perceived that guadua trees are good at regulating humidity around springs and creeks, and they are “useful for construction,\" Mr. Marquez says. For instance, he has built part of his house with this tree.For many people upstream, materials to build houses and fences to protect water are very expensive, so growing guadua is perceived as both, a conservation and economic strategy.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>For Mr. Marquez the main challenge for conservation is the costs of maintaining living fences. Some of his fences have fallen and he needs trees, barbed wire, staples and wages to re-build them, which are beyond his ability to afford.",
	"person_story_amalia": "Amalia moved to the town of Pradera over 20 years ago to be a social worker for the recently established river association Asobolo (Association of users of the Bolo River), eventually becoming the director. In addition to the challenge of introducing a new program, Asobolo's initial work started amidst immense social and economic challenges: Colombia's internal conflict had created a general environment of distrust that discouraged landowners from joining the program. Thanks to Amalia's enduring work with the community, together with the work of thousands of farmers, indigenous communities, and rural communities, over 900 hectares of critical source watershed areas, including 218 springs, are now under conservation.<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Everyone knows Amalia. People wave at her as she drives by and eagerly greet her with \"tinto\" (coffee) and pastries. When asked why they joined the program, a common answer is \"because of Dr. Amalia.\" She explains that her work involves \"long walks and visits\" and \"one-on-one relationships.\" These relationships take time to build and are critical for water funds to work. As Amalia explains, the water fund provides the financial resources and the associations like Asobolo provide presence in the field<div class='paragraph-cut'></div>Now, with better public safety on the horizon, Amalia sees opportunities to conserve the fragile páramo ecosystem in the headwaters of the watershed, which was once off limits due to unrest. She notes the importance of working closely with local communities in this effort - \"we can have all the money of the world, but, if the community does not want to work [with us], the water fund cannot exist.",
